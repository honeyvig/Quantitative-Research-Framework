====================
Here's a Python-based framework for a Quantitative Researcher working at a fintech startup. This script is structured to support tasks such as financial data ingestion, exploratory analysis, and the development of machine learning-driven trading strategies.
Python Code: Quantita
tive Research Framework
1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras yfinance

2. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

The script includes data retrieval, preprocessing, and visualization of financial time series data.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, LSTM, Dropout

# Function to download financial data
def download_data(ticker, start_date, end_date):
    print(f"Downloading data for {ticker}...")
    data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    data['Return'] = data['Close'].pct_change()
    return data

# Preprocess data for machine learning
def preprocess_data(data, look_back=60):
    scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Close']])
    
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(look_back, len(scaled_data)):
        X.append(scaled_data[i-look_back:i, 0])
        y.append(scaled_data[i, 0])
    
    X, y = np.array(X), np.array(y)
    X = np.reshape(X, (X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))
    return X, y, scaler

3. Model Development

This code defines and trains an LSTM-based model for predicting stock prices.

# Build LSTM model
def build_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(input_shape[1], 1)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=False))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(units=1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    return model

# Train the model
def train_model(model, X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32):
    history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=1)
    return history

4. Backtesting and Evaluation

Evaluate model predictions on unseen data and visualize performance.

# Backtest the model
def backtest_model(model, X_test, y_test, scaler, data):
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    predictions = scaler.inverse_transform(predictions)
    actual = scaler.inverse_transform(y_test.reshape(-1, 1))
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
    plt.plot(data.index[-len(actual):], actual, color='blue', label='Actual')
    plt.plot(data.index[-len(predictions):], predictions, color='red', label='Predicted')
    plt.title('Stock Price Prediction')
    plt.xlabel('Time')
    plt.ylabel('Price')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

5. Putting It All Together

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Download data for analysis
    data = download_data("AAPL", start_date="2015-01-01", end_date="2023-01-01")
    
    # Visualize the closing price
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
    plt.plot(data['Close'], label="Close Price")
    plt.title("Apple Stock Price")
    plt.xlabel("Date")
    plt.ylabel("Price")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

    # Prepare data for training
    X, y, scaler = preprocess_data(data)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    # Build and train model
    model = build_model(X_train.shape)
    train_model(model, X_train, y_train)
    
    # Backtest model
    backtest_model(model, X_test, y_test, scaler, data)
